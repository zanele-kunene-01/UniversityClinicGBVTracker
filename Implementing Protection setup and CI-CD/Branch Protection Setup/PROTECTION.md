# Branch Protection Rules

We applied branch protection rules to the `main` branch to ensure code quality and team collaboration.

## Rules Enforced:
- **Require Pull Request Reviews**: Prevents unchecked code from being merged.
- **Status Checks (CI)**: Ensures code passes all tests before integration.
- **No Direct Pushes**: All changes must go through PRs for visibility and review.
- **Include Admins**: Admins must also follow rules.

## Why It Matters
- Guarantees that only tested, reviewed code reaches production.
- Reduces bugs, improves reliability.
- Aligns with DevOps best practices.
