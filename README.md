# UniversityClinicGBVTracker
This project aims to develop a system for tracking gender-based violence (GBV) cases reported by students at a university clinic. The system will provide a secure and confidential platform for reporting, managing, and analyzing GBV cases.
The University Clinic GBV Tracker is a secure and confidential platform designed to help students report gender-based violence (GBV) incidents. The system will enable students to report cases safely, allow clinic staff to manage and track these cases efficiently, and provide tools for data analysis to identify trends and generate reports. Key components include a web application for user interaction, a database for storing case and user information, an authentication service for secure access, and API services for data handling. The system will ensure data security and privacy, complying with relevant regulations to protect sensitive information.

 **Class Implementation**

# Domain Classes â€“ University GBV Tracker

## Key Classes
- `User`: Represents a student, counselor, or admin
- `Report`: Represents a GBV case report
- `Case`: Tracks the investigation and status
- `Notification`: Manages communication with stakeholders

## Package Structure
- `/models`: Domain model classes
- `/repositories`: Data layer abstraction
- `/services`: Business logic (optional)
- `/tests`: Test coverage

## Notes
Each domain class is serializable and contains minimal logic to maintain clean separation from services. IDs are used as primary identifiers in the repository layer.

**Unit Testing â€“ GBV Tracker Repository** 

## Focus
Unit tests are designed for `InMemory*Repository` classes to ensure reliable CRUD operations without dependency on external databases.

## Tools
- JUnit 5
- Mockito (optional for services)

## Tested Methods
- `save()`: Adds or updates entries
- `findById()`: Retrieves entries by ID
- `findAll()`: Lists all entries
- `delete()`: Deletes an entry

## Running Tests

```bash
./gradlew test

**Repository Structure**

 Features Implemented

| Feature | Description | Justification |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Repository Interface Abstraction** | Defined generic repository interfaces for key entities (e.g., `ReportRepository`, `UserRepository`). | Promotes **code reusability**, **loose coupling**, and easier unit testing. |
| **In-Memory Repository Implementations** | Implemented repositories using `HashMap` for runtime data storage. | Enables **quick development** and **testability** without requiring a database. |
| **Factory Pattern for Storage Selection** | Created `RepositoryFactory` to dynamically instantiate repository types. | **Encapsulates object creation** and allows **extensibility** for future storage backends. |
| **Stub for Future Storage (Database)** | Included placeholder classes for database repositories (e.g., `DatabaseReportRepository`). | **Future-proofs** the system by planning for external storage integration. |
| **Unit Testing for Repository Layer** | Created JUnit tests to verify in-memory CRUD operations. | Ensures **reliability**, **test coverage**, and **early detection** of defects. |

Assignment 12 Implementation

### 1. Service Layer
Implemented service classes for:
- `ReportService`
- `UserService`
- `CaseService`

Each service:
- Uses in-memory repository from Assignment 11
- Validates input and enforces basic rules

### 2. REST API
Developed using **FastAPI**:
- `POST /api/reports` â€“ Create a report
- `GET /api/reports/{id}` â€“ Get report by ID
- `GET /api/reports` â€“ List all reports
- `DELETE /api/reports/{id}` â€“ Delete a report

### 3. Documentation
Swagger UI is auto-generated by FastAPI:
- Visit: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

OpenAPI JSON can be exported to `/docs/openapi.json`

### 4. GitHub Activity
- Issues created for each service & API
- Linked commits with messages like: `Close #5: Implement report API`
- Screenshot uploaded in `/docs/github_board.png`
