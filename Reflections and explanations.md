**Kanban Board Explanation**

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that uses columns to represent different stages of a workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Each task is represented by a card that moves through the columns as it progresses. This visualization helps teams see the status of tasks at a glance and manage their workflow effectively.

Our custom Kanban board visualizes the workflow by using columns such as To Do, In Progress, Testing, Blocked, and Done. This structure ensures that tasks are clearly categorized based on their current status. By limiting the number of tasks in the In Progress column, we prevent bottlenecks and ensure that team members focus on completing tasks before starting new ones. This approach supports Agile principles by promoting continuous delivery and adaptability, allowing the team to respond to changes and deliver value incrementally.

The Testing column ensures that tasks undergo quality assurance before being marked as complete, aligning with QA requirements. The Blocked column helps identify and address issues that may hinder progress, ensuring that critical tasks are not delayed. By visualizing the workflow and limiting work-in-progress, the Kanban board helps the team maintain focus, manage tasks efficiently, and deliver high-quality results.
