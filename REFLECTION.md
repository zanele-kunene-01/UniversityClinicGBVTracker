# Reflection: Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

1. Confidentiality vs. Accessibility:
   Challenge: Ensuring that student reports are confidential while allowing authorized personnel to access necessary information. Students need their reports to be confidential, but clinic staff and security personnel require access to manage and respond to cases.

2. Ease of Use vs. Security:
    Challenge: Designing a user-friendly interface for students while implementing robust security measures. Students want a simple reporting process, but IT staff need to ensure that the system is secure and data is encrypted.

3. Timely Notifications vs. Bandwidth Limitations:
   Challenge: Providing instant notifications to students, clinic staff, and security personnel without overloading the network. Students and security personnel require instant notifications about case status and new incidents, but IT staff must manage bandwidth usage.

4. Efficient Case Management vs. Overwhelming Workload:
  Challenge: Enabling clinic staff to manage cases efficiently without being overwhelmed by the volume of reports. Clinic staff need tools to streamline case management, but an influx of reports could still lead to an overwhelming workload.

5. Data Accuracy vs. Ease of Access:
   Challenge: Ensuring data accuracy for analysis while making it easily accessible to data analysts. Data analysts need accurate and consistent data for reports, but the system must also provide streamlined access to this data.

6. Compliance vs. Flexibility:
   Challenge: Meeting regulatory compliance requirements while allowing flexibility in system configuration. University administrators need compliance reports, but IT staff and administrators also require the ability to update system settings without downtime.

7. Timely Interventions vs. Delayed Information:
   Challenge: Providing counselors with timely access to case details to support students effectively. Counselors need immediate access to comprehensive case details, but delays in information retrieval can hinder timely interventions.

8. Coordination vs. Privacy:
   Challenge: Facilitating coordination between clinic staff and the University Security Department while maintaining privacy. Security personnel need to coordinate with clinic staff for effective incident management, but student privacy must be protected.

9. System Uptime vs. Maintenance:
   Challenge: Ensuring high system uptime while performing necessary maintenance and updates. IT staff need to maintain system uptime (99.9%), but regular maintenance and updates are required to keep the system secure and functional.

10. Immediate Needs vs. Long-Term Goals:
Challenge: Addressing urgent needs of stakeholders while keeping long-term system improvements in mind. Immediate needs such as instant notifications and case management tools must be balanced with long-term goals like scalability and future integrations.
