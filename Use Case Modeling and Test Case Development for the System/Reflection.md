Translating requirements into use cases and test cases is a critical step in the software development process. It ensures that the system meets stakeholder needs and performs as expected. However, this process is fraught with challenges that require careful consideration and meticulous planning. Here are some of the key challenges we faced while translating requirements into use cases and tests for the University Clinic GBV Tracker project:

1. Conflicting Stakeholder Priorities
One of the primary challenges was balancing conflicting priorities among stakeholders. For example, students prioritized confidentiality and ease of reporting, while IT staff focused on system security and uptime. Clinic staff needed efficient case management, whereas university administrators were concerned with compliance and system effectiveness. Balancing these diverse needs required careful analysis and negotiation to ensure that all critical requirements were addressed without compromising any stakeholder's concerns.

2. Ensuring Comprehensive Coverage
Another challenge was ensuring that all functional requirements were comprehensively covered by the use cases. Each requirement needed to be translated into specific actions that users would perform with the system. This involved identifying all possible interactions and ensuring that no requirement was overlooked. For instance, the requirement for data analysts to generate accurate reports had to be broken down into detailed steps within the use case for analyzing data.

3. Avoiding Contradictions
Avoiding contradictions between use cases and requirements was crucial. Each use case had to align perfectly with the corresponding requirements to ensure consistency. For example, the use case for reporting GBV cases needed to ensure confidentiality while also being user-friendly. This required careful design to balance ease of use with robust security measures, avoiding any contradictions that could undermine the system's effectiveness.

4. Defining Clear Preconditions and Postconditions
Defining clear preconditions and postconditions for each use case was essential to ensure that the system's state before and after the use case was well understood. This helped in validating the system's behavior and ensuring that it met the expected outcomes. For instance, the precondition for the use case where students report GBV cases was that the student must be logged in, and the postcondition was that the report is saved and encrypted.

5. Handling Alternative Flows
Identifying and handling alternative flows was another challenge. Each use case needed to account for possible errors or exceptions, ensuring that the system could handle these scenarios gracefully. For example, if a student submits an incomplete report, the system should prompt them to fill in the missing details. This required careful planning to ensure that all potential issues were addressed.

6. Matching Test Cases with Requirements
Developing test cases that accurately validated the functional and non-functional requirements was challenging. Each test case needed to be directly linked to a specific requirement, ensuring that the system's behavior was thoroughly tested. For example, the test case for performance needed to simulate 1,000 concurrent users to validate the system's response time, ensuring it met the requirement of â‰¤ 2 seconds.

7. Ensuring Data Privacy and Security
Ensuring data privacy and security was a critical concern, especially given the sensitive nature of GBV reports. The use cases and test cases needed to validate that all data was encrypted and accessible only to authorized personnel. This involved implementing robust security measures and testing them thoroughly to ensure compliance.
