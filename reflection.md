Selecting and customizing the template for our project presented several challenges. One of the main challenges was evaluating the different templates and determining which one best suited our needs. Each template had its strengths and weaknesses, and it was important to choose one that aligned with our Agile methodology and project requirements.

Challenges in Template Selection: The process of selecting the most suitable template involved a thorough analysis of GitHub’s project templates, including Basic Kanban, Automated Kanban, Bug Triage, and Team Planning. Each template offered unique features, such as different columns and workflows, automation capabilities, and suitability for Agile methodologies. The Automated Kanban template was ultimately chosen for its robust automation features, which are crucial for managing the University Clinic GBV Tracker project efficiently. However, the decision was not straightforward. Evaluating the templates required a deep understanding of the project’s needs and how each template could address those needs. The challenge was to balance simplicity with functionality, ensuring that the chosen template would streamline the workflow without adding unnecessary complexity.

Challenges in Customizing the Kanban Board: Customizing the Kanban board posed its own set of challenges. The goal was to create a board that accurately reflected the workflow stages of the project while addressing specific needs such as quality assurance and issue resolution. Adding columns like "Testing" and "Blocked" was essential to ensure tasks undergo thorough testing and to identify any obstacles that might hinder progress. However, deciding on the right number and type of columns required careful consideration. Too few columns might oversimplify the workflow, while too many could complicate task management. The challenge was to strike a balance that would enhance visibility and efficiency without overwhelming the team.

Comparing GitHub’s Templates to Other Tools: When comparing GitHub’s templates to other project management tools like Trello and Jira, several differences and similarities emerged. Trello is known for its flexibility and user-friendly interface, making it easy to customize boards and manage tasks. However, it lacks some of the automation features that GitHub provides, which are crucial for streamlining workflows in complex projects like the University Clinic GBV Tracker. Jira, on the other hand, offers extensive customization options and powerful Agile tools, making it ideal for large-scale projects. However, its complexity can be a drawback, especially for teams that are new to Agile methodologies. GitHub strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality, offering robust integration with version control and development workflows, which is particularly beneficial for software projects.

Lessons Learned: The process of selecting and customizing the template provided valuable insights into project management and Agile methodologies. One key lesson learned was the importance of aligning the project management tool with the specific needs of the project. The Automated Kanban template was chosen because it supports sprint tracking and automation, which are essential for managing the University Clinic GBV Tracker project efficiently. Another lesson was the significance of customization in enhancing workflow visibility and efficiency. Adding columns like "Testing" and "Blocked" helped address specific needs and ensured that tasks were managed effectively.

Challenges in Prioritization and Estimation: As the sole stakeholder, prioritizing tasks objectively and estimating effort accurately were significant challenges. Personal biases and preferences could influence decisions, leading to resistance in prioritizing tasks that are less appealing but necessary. Accurate estimation requires experience and knowledge of the project’s scope, and without feedback from others, making precise estimates was difficult. The challenge was to balance immediate needs with long-term goals, ensuring that the project progressed steadily while addressing critical tasks.

Managing Expectations and Communication: Setting realistic expectations and maintaining clear communication were crucial for successful Agile implementation. As the sole stakeholder, managing expectations required transparency and regular updates to ensure that the project stayed on track. Establishing clear communication channels and regular updates helped prevent miscommunication and ensured that all requirements were understood and translated accurately into tasks.
